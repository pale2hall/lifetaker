# lifetaker
This is a [https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit|Bukkit] / Craftbukkit / Spigot/Paper/Etc(?) plugin to trade lives via PVP.  

I built it for the DewPocalypse event map on DewCraft and PaleCraft.  

This repository has not been touched in years, but I wanted to shared the code.

It is very simple, feel free to browse and borrow any code.
